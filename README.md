# Project Title: Stellar Stories: Space Weather Through the Eyes of Earthlings
# Project Description
Stellar Stories is an interactive educational web application designed to make the complex science of space weather accessible and exciting for a global audience. Our project uses a unique dual-perspective approach to storytelling. Users can experience the universe through the eyes of cosmic phenomena themselves—like Cammie the CME or Sunny the Solar Flare—to understand their journey. Simultaneously, other stories are told from the perspective of Earthlings, showing how these cosmic events tangibly affect our lives and technology. This method makes the science of heliophysics both imaginative and deeply relatable.

# Our Solution
Our solution is a web platform that offers a diverse library of "choose-your-own-adventure" stories. Users are active participants in the narrative, making choices that determine the outcome. One moment, you might be guiding a lost pilot through a cosmic storm as Aurora; the next, you might be a photographer on Earth witnessing the strange effects of a geomagnetic anomaly.

This narrative core is powered by a flexible JSON engine and brought to life with beautiful Lottie animations for each chapter. The entire experience is wrapped in a polished, game-like interface with 3D and parallax effects, transforming complex scientific concepts from NASA into a memorable and fun adventure.

# Technology Stack
## Frontend: 
  A modern Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite.

## Styling: 
  Tailwind CSS for the futuristic, responsive, and aurora-themed design.

## Animation:

  ### Framer Motion:
  for all fluid UI animations, 3D card tilts, and interactive effects.

  ### Lottie:
  for rendering the detailed narrative animations.

## Navigation: 
  React Router for managing all client-side page routing.

# Key Advantages
### Dual-Perspective Storytelling: 
By telling stories from both a cosmic and a human viewpoint, we make the science both fantastical and personally relevant.
### Interactive Learning: 
The choice-based format actively engages users, leading to better understanding and knowledge retention than passive learning.
Scientifically Grounded: Each story is built on the fundamental principles of heliophysics and space weather as studied by NASA, ensuring an educational foundation.
Broad Appeal: The variety of stories and perspectives appeals to different learning styles and interests, making it an ideal tool for classrooms, families, and curious minds of any age.
